# Attendance-System
This project it made for attendance monitoring,  using face recognition library and Python and also OpenCV is used to make it in real time that means it can take image from the web cam, encode the face  and matches it with the images that present in a image folder with their proper name and store it in a csv file if the name is not present in the csv file along with the time. To make it simple I use only name and time and use only 5 individuals, but if you want you can include id and so many things in the csv file.  If you want to modify the program to identify all the faces in the class you have to just take a photo of a student, rename it with their Real Name and paste it in the Image Library.
